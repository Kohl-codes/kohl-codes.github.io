            <strong>What should I wear to my first martial arts class?</strong>
            <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i>
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>Answer:<em> For your first class, wear comfortable workout clothes such as a t-shirt and athletic shorts
                    or sweatpants. You'll also need to go barefoot or wear clean indoor martial arts shoes, as outdoor
                    shoes are generally not allowed on the training mats.</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <strong>How often should I train to see progress in martial arts?</strong>
            <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i>
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>Answer: <em>Consistency is key. Most practitioners see noticeable improvements by training 2-4 times a
                    week. However, the frequency may vary depending on your goals and the intensity of your training.

            <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i>
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>Answer: <em> Martial arts can be safe for children when taught by experienced and qualified instructors.
                    Many martial arts schools have specialized programs for kids, focusing on discipline, respect, and
                    age-appropriate techniques to ensure a safe and enjoyable learning experience.

            <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i>
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>Answer: <em>The effectiveness of a martial art for self-defense depends on various factors, including
                    your personal preferences and the specific situation. Krav Maga, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Muay Thai
                    are often recommended for practical self-defense due to their focus on real-world scenarios and

        </p>
        <div>
            <p>Answer: <em>No, you don't need to be in great shape to start martial arts. Martial arts training can help
                    you improve your fitness level over time. Instructors can tailor workouts to your current fitness
                    level, allowing you to progress at your own pace and improve your physical condition as you train.
